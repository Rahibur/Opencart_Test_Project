# Overview 
As part of the project, ‘OpenCart’ Rahib conducted a test of a few functionalities of  
‘[http://localhost/opencart/upload/index.php?route=common/home](http://localhost/opencart/upload/index.php?route=common/home) ”  web application.  
This document serves as a high-level test planning document with details on the  
project's scope, test strategy, test schedule, resource requirements,  
test deliverables, and schedule.

# Scope 
The scope of the project includes testing the following features of  
‘[http://localhost/opencart/upload/index.php?route=common/home](http://localhost/opencart/upload/index.php?route=common/home) ’  web application. Inclusions

From our understanding, the above functional areas need to be Tested.

# Test Environments
• Windows 10 – Chrome, Firefox,Opera GX browser  and Edge  

**Exclusions**  
• All the features except that are mentioned under ‘Inclusions’  
• Any third-party features or Payment gateways • Test Automation 

# Test Strategy

### Test Scenarios and Test Cases Creation

* Design test cases using techniques like:  
  * Equivalence Class Partitioning  
  * Boundary Value Analysis  
  * Decision Table Testing  
  * State Transition Testing  
  * Use Case Testing  
* Apply additional methods:  
  * Error Guessing  
  * Exploratory Testing  
* Prioritize test cases.

### Testing Process

* Perform **Smoke Testing** on initial builds.  
  * Reject unstable builds and wait for a stable version.  
* Conduct in-depth testing with test cases after the build passes Smoke Testing.  
* Test the application in multiple environments simultaneously.  
* Report bugs in a tracking tool and provide daily status updates.  
* Types of testing performed:  
  * Smoke and Sanity Testing  
  * Regression and Retesting  
  * Usability, Functionality, and UI Testing  
* Repeat test cycles until the product meets quality standards.

### Best Practices

* **Context-Driven Testing**: Test based on the specific application context.  
* **Shift Left Testing**: Begin testing early in the development process.  
* **Exploratory Testing**: Leverage expertise for additional insights beyond test cases.

### Defect Reporting

1. **Noting Deviations:**  
   * Record any behavior that doesn't match expectations.  
   * Report as a defect, observation, issue, or question if needed.  
2. **Usability Issues:**

   * Highlight and report usability concerns.  
3. **Defect Verification:**  
   * Retest the defect to confirm it is reproducible.  
   * Document steps to reproduce with screenshots.  
4. **Daily Reporting:**

   * Share all defects and observations at the end of each testing day.

# Suspension and Resumption Criteria

Based on the Client decision, we will suspend and resume the Project. We will ramp up and ramp down the resources as per Client needs.

### Tools 
The following are the list of Tools we will be using in this Project:  
**• Bugzilla Bug Tracking Tool**  
**• Mind map Tool(Xmind)**  
**• Snipping Screenshot Tool**  
**• Word and Excel documents**

# Risks and Mitigations 
The following are the list of risks possible and the ways to mitigate them:

**Risk:** Non-Availability of a Resource  
**Mitigation:** Backup Resource Planning  
**Risk:** Build URL is not working  
**Mitigation:** Resources will work on other tasks  
**Risk:** Less time for Testing  
**Mitigation:** Ramp up the resources based on the Client's needs dynamically

### Approvals 
The team will send different types of documents for Client Approval like below:  
• Test Plan  
• Test Scenarios  
• Test Cases  
• Reports

Testing will only continue to the next steps once these approvals are done.
